              <b>I'm Jibran,</b>
              A student with a passion for
              <span class="cyan-text font-700">Backend Development</span>.
              Currently pursuing a degree in Information System.

              <b>Outside of classroom,</b>
              I kept my focus on learning from many platforms such as Udemy and
              YouTube. And then apply the knowledge i acquired through hands-on
              projects. You can view it in
              <span class="cyan-text font-700">Projects</span> or in my Github
              Repository.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>How it all started.</b> Back then, i didn't have a clear
              interest that truly captivated me and it wasn't until i discovered
              programming that everything i learned started to "click". But
              still, i was skeptical about whether this was the right path for
              me, but as time went by i became increasingly convinced that it
              was a good fit.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>What i love</b>
              most about programming is that i can see the progress of what i am
              building. Seeing the lines of code transform into a functional
              application is just satisfying.
